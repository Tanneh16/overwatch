                shortly after i moved back to the Glendale and moved to Fresno in

            <p>On November 25th, 2008, i enlisted with one of my best friends after giving
                my recruiter the run around my senior year. I joined the Army National Guard
                 and went to Fort Benning, Georgia. Around June 5th, 2009 i became an Infantrymen 
                 out of B-119 in Sandhill. Myself and few others picked up an airborne contract throughout 
                 basic and graduated in July. After 6 years and canceled deployments i was counting on, i
                  decided to stick to my ETS date of November 24th, 2014 after failed attempts to 
                  change my MOS and unit</p>
